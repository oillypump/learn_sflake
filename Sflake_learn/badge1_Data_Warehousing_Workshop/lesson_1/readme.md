# Lessong 1: Getting Set Up

## Meet Tsai!

Meet Tsai. Tsai is a data professional, and she loves her job. She especially loves adding new data sets to her company's product offering, even though she doesn't really enjoy the numerous meetings, phone calls and emails that are needed to keep the various data sets flowing over time. 
She also loves it when new database features are released or when her company gets faster servers, even though she doesn't really like maintenance, downtime, pager duty and weekend hardware upgrades. But most of all, she loves tailoring access to the data so that different user groups can get what they need at high speeds and low cost.
Then again, she doesn't love it that this fine tuning sometimes means creating data silos just to keep things running both fast and cheap.
Tsai recently asked her boss if she could spend some time exploring Snowflake because she's heard that a move to Snowflake would allow her to do more of what she loves and a whole lot less of the things she doesn't love.
Her boss is excited about the proposal because he's been wanting to know more about Snowflake, too. Tsai and her boss agree that she'll use a Snowflake trial to do the Essentials Data Warehousing Workshop.


## Two User Interfaces (UIs) 
The Main or Home interface is used for managing and viewing objects. The Worksheets interface is used for running SQL commands. Both interfaces have object pickers. Object pickers are hierarchical trees that allow you to find and select the objects you want to work with.  Many actions are possible from either interface choosing which interface to use depends on whether you prefer menu-driven or code-driven action.  

## Why a Trial Account?

Tsai is ready to begin the Data Warehousing Workshop. She starts by navigating to signup.snowflake.com. She fills in her contact information and clicks continue. Before she has a chance to fill out the second screen, a call comes through from her former coworker and friend, Kishore.
Kishore has been using Snowflake for a while now, and he's already completed the Data Warehousing Workshop. Tsai asks him which options he thinks she should choose for her trial account.
Kishore tells her it's important to read the workshop requirements. He always double checks the requirements before he signs up for a new trial. Tsai is confused.
Why would Kishore need a trial? He already has a Snowflake user account as part of his job. Kishore explains that when using his work account, he only has access to some Snowflake features based on his job requirements.
But during the workshops, by using a trial account, he's able to see and use all of Snowflake features and he can try new things without worrying that he'll mess something up. Tsai checks the workshop requirements and submits the trial sign up form.
She now sees a confirmation message. The message quickly updates telling her to check her email. The email includes an activation link and by following it she's able to create a username and password for her trial.
When her new trial account opens, Tsai is confused again. The user interface, or UI, looks different than what she was expecting. Kishore explains that Snowflake changes all the time because it's constantly improving, but usually the changes are pretty small.
Lately, though, there have been some even bigger changes. A new, simpler UI has become available. The old UI is still around, but now it's called the Classic Console. Tsai uses a Classic Console link to open the ClassicConsole in a separate browser tab.
Then she clicks back and forth between them, noticing the similarities and differences. Kishore points out that depending on when a learner starts the workshop, they may see more of one UI than another, but luckily the concepts are the same regardless of which UI you use.
He advises Tsai that if anything doesn't look exactly like a screenshot in the workshop, she should trust herself to look around and try to find the way to complete the task anyway. The Essentials workshops are designed for people who like to be self directed.
They like figuring things out and Kishore knows Tsai likes a challenge. He reminds her that if she gets confused, she can use the learner discussion boards within the course to get back on track. She can also use Snowflake online documentation and the community forums to find answers.
If she decides she'd like more of a guided experience, she can sign up for an instructor led course where she can get immediate answers and help from Snowflake expert instructors.

NOTE: As of October 13, 2022, the Classic Console is no longer available without significant efforts by users and we no longer support its use in this workshop.
