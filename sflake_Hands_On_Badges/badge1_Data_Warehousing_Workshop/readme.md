# Badge 1: Data Warehousing Workshop 

[up](../../README.md) 

## Hands-On Essentials Series
This course is the first in the Hands On Essentials Series. This series allows you to earn a Badge for display on LinkedIn and other social media. The Essentials Series uses active learning principles to give you a fast paced, hands on experience. Short videos, step-by-step labs, reflection questions, and challenge labs work together to build your knowledge and skills as you build a solution.

## Prior Knowledge & Experience
As our flagship course, there are no prerequisites. You should know how to use a web browser but beyond that, you don't need to even need to know what a database is! It does NOT require prior experience with Snowflake.

## Scenario Based
We do our work alongside Tsai Yang, a data engineer who is reviewing Snowflake for her company's possible move to Snowflake. We also observe as Tsai introduces Snowflake and database concepts to her Uncle Yer, who has never used a database before but finds Snowflake clear and easy to learn.

## Effort & Duration
Plan for 3 hours of effort a day for 3 days in a row. If you choose to complete the workshop in a single sitting, that's fine with us.

## Grading
To complete the workshop you will run scripts that are autograded by DORA, our grading robot.

## Lab Environment
Don't sign up for a trial account until you are given step-by-step instructions within the course flow. Since this is the first course, we are more precise with the steps.
